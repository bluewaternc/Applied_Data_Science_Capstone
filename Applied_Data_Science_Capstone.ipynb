    "<p>My hometown of Apex is a growing suburb located outside of Raleigh, NC. It's population is around 60,000. While it has many of the amenities that are attractive for suburban residents, it seems to be lacking in access to high quality coffee shops. There are plenty of places to grab an average beverage, but few establishments that cater to gourmet coffee connoisseurs.</p>\n",

    "<p>The market for coffee drinkers is strong. Approximately 63% of Americans are coffee drinkers. Of those consumers, around 61% consume “gourmet” coffee (1). Additionally, around 36% of the population consumes coffee brewed outside of the home (2). In general, these statistics have an upward trend (3).</p>\n",

They have hired me to perform a data based analysis to determine a list of the top 5 locations for a Gourmet Coffee Shop in Apex.</p>\n",
